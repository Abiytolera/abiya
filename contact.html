    <p align="center">Dear Inspector </p>
    
    <div class="text-container"> 
        <p>This letter is written following your call to present a document confirming the legality of my stay in Poland on the day of applying. </p>
<br>
My resident card was valid until September 30, 2023, due to that I was there to apply on September 26, 2023. 
<br>
The English advisor that day working on window number 7 looked into my documents and told me I lacked one document, annex attachment number 1. 
<br>
He told me my application would take a long time (20 months) due to the lack of this document that day and advised me to prepare this document within one month after September 30, 2023. Additionally, he informed me that the office started a fast-track process, and for my application to be on the fast track I have to submit all documents together. I reputedly asked him to confirm that I can apply after September 30, 2023, and he informed me I have 30 days to collect all documents and apply after the validity date of my TRC. This communication takes place on the English advisor window number 7 on September 26, 2023, between 10:30 am and 11:00 am.
<br>
During this period, I have been employed at Concentrix CVG International and provided my fingerprint on December 8, 2023. 
<br>
I would like to emphasize that I have been working in Poland since July 24, 2023, up to the present date.
<br>
I respectfully request the office to look into this case and find the communication records on September 26, 2023, between 10:30 am and 11:00 am. For your reference, I will attach a copy of a handwritten document by the advisor on that day and the missing documents are those under the brace bracket. 
<br>
I am confident that after reviewing the records, the office will recognize the circumstances and take them into account when evaluating my application. 
<br>
Thank you for paying attention to this matter. 
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Abiy Tolera Megersa
